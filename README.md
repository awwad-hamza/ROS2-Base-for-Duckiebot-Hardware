## ðŸ¦† About

ROS2 Base for Duckiebot Hardware is a pre-configured ROS 2 Foxy environment optimized for the duckiebot DB21M robotics platform running on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit. It provides a ready-to-use setup that streamlines development, deployment, and experimentation with ROS 2 on embedded systems.

## SD Card Preparation for Jetson Nano Developer Kit

Follow the steps below to prepare your SD card and set up your Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit.

### 1. Download the Official SD Card Image
- Visit NVIDIAâ€™s [official download page](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/downloads).
- Download the image file for the Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit.

### 2. Flash the Image to a microSD Card
- Use [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) or any other reliable flashing tool to write the downloaded image to a **new microSD card**.
- Ensure the flashing process completes successfully before removing the SD card.

### 3. Boot the Jetson Nano
- Insert the newly flashed microSD card into your Jetson Nano.
- Power on the Jetson Nano and follow the on-screen setup instructions.

### 4. System Configuration
To align your setup with the **Duckietown shell environment** (`duckie@HOSTNAME`):

- **Username:** enter `duckie` in the *Pick a username* field.  
- **Hostname:** choose a suitable hostname in the *Your computerâ€™s name* field.  
- **Password:** use `quackquack` to match the default Duckietown (`dts`) setup.

> **Note:** These configuration choices are optional but recommended to maintain compatibility with Duckietown conventions for future use.

## PCâ€“Jetson Communication Setup
This step will let you connect to your Jetson Nano from your PC using either Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
Youâ€™ll need a keyboard, screen, and (optionally) a mouse connected to the Jetson for this setup â€” at least until you can SSH into it remotely.
> Note: You can always operate the Jetson directly using a screen and keyboard, but setting up SSH makes development much more convenient.
### On the Jetson
1. Create a new Ethernet connection with a static IP
```
nmcli connection add type ethernet ifname eth0 con-name duckie-eth ip4 10.42.0.2/24 gw4 10.42.0.1
```
2. Set the DNS server for name resolution
```
nmcli connection modify duckie-eth ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8"
```
3. Bring the new Ethernet connection online
```
nmcli connection up duckie-eth
```
4. Enable automatic reconnection at boot
```
nmcli connection modify duckie-eth connection.autoconnect yes
```

### On Host PC
1. Before setting up the Ethernet connection, clear any previous SSH key entries associated with the Jetsonâ€™s IP (this can happen if youâ€™ve reflashed the Jetson or changed its configuration):
```
ssh-keygen -f "$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "10.42.0.2"
```
This ensures SSH will not complain about changed host keys.

2. Next, configure a static IP on your PCâ€™s Ethernet interface so itâ€™s on the same subnet as the Jetson:
```
sudo nmcli connection add type ethernet ifname enp2s0 con-name jetson-link ip4 10.42.0.1/24
sudo nmcli connection up jetson-link
```
---
Once the connection is active, you can SSH into your Jetson from your PC using:
```
ssh duckie@10.42.0.2
```

### (Optional) Set Up Wi-Fi on the Jetson
You can either connect your Jetson Nano directly to Wi-Fi or share your PCâ€™s internet connection through an Ethernet bridge.
In this section, weâ€™ll go through the Wi-Fi setup method, which is often simpler and ensures your Jetson can access the internet for installing packages, pulling Docker images, and running updates.
> Note: Note: Having an active internet connection on the Jetson is essential for most development tasks.

> Make sure the Wi-Fi dongle is connected to the jetson before this task.

Access your Jetson with a keyboard and monitor, or SSH into it over Ethernet.
>Note: nano is not installed by default on the Jetson, so youâ€™ll need to install it first using: `sudo apt install nano`

```
nmcli radio wifi on
sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
```
Look for the following section:
```
[ifupdown]
managed=false
```
If `managed=false` is set, change it to:
```
[ifupdown]
managed=true
```
Save and close the file (Ctrl + O, Enter, Ctrl + X), then restart the NetworkManager service:
```
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

### Connect to a Wi-Fi Network
To view available Wi-Fi networks:
```
nmcli device wifi list
```
Then connect to your desired network:
```
nmcli device wifi connect "SSID" password "your_password"
```
Replace `SSID` and `your_password` with your actual Wi-Fi network name and password.

> Note: Connecting to a university or public Wi-Fi network (such as `eduroam`), may not be as straightforward as this.


## Docker Installation
Follow the steps below to install and verify Docker on your Jetson Nano.
### Install Docker on the Jetson
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo reboot
```
Verify the Installation
```
docker --version
```
You should see the installed **Docker Engine version** displayed on your Jetson Nano.
To confirm Docker is working properly, run the Hello World container:
```
docker run hello-world
```
If it runs successfully, Docker is correctly installed and functioning.

### Verify NVIDIA runtine
Check whether the NVIDIA runtime is available:
```
sudo docker info | grep Runtimes
```
It should display an output similar to:
```
Runtimes: io.containerd.runc.v2 io.containerd.runtime.v1.linux nvidia runc
```
If `nvidia` is missing, follow the steps below to fix it:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-runtime
sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
```
Update the file contents as follows:
```
{
    "runtimes": {
        "nvidia": {
            "path": "nvidia-container-runtime",
            "runtimeArgs": []
        }
    },
    "default-runtime": "nvidia"
}
```
Save the file, then restart the Docker service:
```
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## Verify GPU devices on the host
```
ls /dev/nv*
```
- You should see multiple `nvhost-*` devices.
- This confirms the Jetson GPU is visible to Docker containers.
