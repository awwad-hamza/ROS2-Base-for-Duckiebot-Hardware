## ðŸ¦† About

ROS2 Base for Duckiebot Hardware is a pre-configured ROS 2 Foxy environment optimized for the duckiebot DB21M robotics platform running on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit. It provides a ready-to-use setup that streamlines development, deployment, and experimentation with ROS 2 on embedded systems.

## SD Card Preparation for Jetson Nano Developer Kit

Follow the steps below to prepare your SD card and set up your Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit.

### 1. Download the Official SD Card Image
- Visit NVIDIAâ€™s [official download page](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/downloads).
- Download the image file for the Jetson Nano 2GB Developer Kit.

### 2. Flash the Image to a microSD Card
- Use [Balena Etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) or any other reliable flashing tool to write the downloaded image to a **new microSD card**.
- Ensure the flashing process completes successfully before removing the SD card.

### 3. Boot the Jetson Nano
- Insert the newly flashed microSD card into your Jetson Nano.
- Power on the Jetson Nano and follow the on-screen setup instructions.

### 4. System Configuration
To align your setup with the **Duckietown shell environment** (`duckie@HOSTNAME`):

- **Username:** enter `duckie` in the *Pick a username* field.  
- **Hostname:** choose a suitable hostname in the *Your computerâ€™s name* field.  
- **Password:** use `quackquack` to match the default Duckietown (`dts`) setup.

> **Note:** These configuration choices are optional but recommended to maintain compatibility with Duckietown conventions for future use.

## Prerequisites

Docker installed (comes with JetPack).

NVIDIA container runtime available (installed by default).

Optional: USB or CSI camera (for camera passthrough).

//////////////////////////////////

## Verify Docker and NVIDIA runtime
### 1. Check Docker version:
```
docker --version
```
It should display the installed Docker Engine version on your Jetson Nano.

### 2. Check available runtimes:
```
sudo docker info | grep Runtimes
```
It should display something like:
```
Runtimes: io.containerd.runc.v2 io.containerd.runtime.v1.linux nvidia runc
```
If `nvidia` is missing, fix it:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-runtime
sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
```
Add (or edit) the file to include:
```
{
    "runtimes": {
        "nvidia": {
            "path": "nvidia-container-runtime",
            "runtimeArgs": []
        }
    },
    "default-runtime": "nvidia"
}
```
Then restart Docker:
```
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## Verify GPU devices on the host
```
ls /dev/nv*
```
- You should see multiple `nvhost-*` devices.
- This confirms the Jetson GPU is visible to Docker containers.
